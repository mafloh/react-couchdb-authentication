# React CouchDB Authentication Component

React component for authenticating against a CouchDB user db and syncing it locally with PouchDB.

_This project is still a work in progress._

The intention is to provide an easy component to wrap an application that utilizes PouchDB and authenticate it against a CouchDB instance.
